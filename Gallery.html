            League of Legends player who currently competes for T1. He gained prominence after joining SK Telecom T1
            (now T1) in 2013, where he has since played as the team's mid laner. Often hailed as the "Michael Jordan of
            esports", Faker is widely regarded as the greatest League of Legends player in history. Throughout his
            career, he has secured a record of 10 League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK) titles, two Mid-Season

In April 2004, South Korean wireless carrier SK Telecom began sponsoring the team, officially creating the team SK Telecom T1.
