      <p class="sizeabout">
        League of Legends has 2 primary game modes, Summoners Rift and ARAM. Summoners Rift is a 5v5 game mode where each team has to destroy the enemy nexus. ARAM is a 5v5 game mode where each team has to destroy the enemy nexus but the map is smaller and you can't go back to base to buy items.

          <p class="sizeabout">The objective of Summoner's Rift is simple â€“ destroy the enemy nexus. In order to do this, champions must traverse down one of three different paths (or lanes) in order to attack their enemy at their weakest points they can exploit. Both teams have their lanes defended by numerous turrets; each turret grows in strength the closer it gets to its respective nexus and each turret must be eliminated in order to gain access to the next turret in that lane. Cooperating with fellow summoners is an absolute requirement for success, as it is easy for a champion to find themselves ambushed by enemies in the lanes of the Rift.</P>

          <p class="sizeabout">ARAM, abbreviation of All Random, All Mid, is a game mode in League of Legends in a 5v5 format on the Howling Abyss icon Howling Abyss, where the objective is to destroy the opposing team's Nexus. The game includes an Reroll All random draft type, and a game that takes place only on one long lane (specifically referencing its resemblance to Summoner's Rift icon Summoner's Rift's middle lane).</P>
